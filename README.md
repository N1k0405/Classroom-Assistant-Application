# Classroom Assistant Application

## DISCLAIMER

> **Note**: This project was developed at the beginning of my coding journey when my knowledge was limited. As a result, the project may contain suboptimal formatting and insufficient commenting. Please refer to version 2 of this project for technical improvements and improved coding practices. As seen in the code, given my knowledge at the time, I utilized clever solutions for data management, particularly through local text file storage, as I was restricted to using Java and file I/O.

## Success Criteria (Prior to Programming)
- **Student Management**: The client should easily enter and store student names for multiple classes.
- **Test Scores**: The client should input test scores for each student.
- **Group Creation**: The client should be able to create random groups of any specified size.
- **Intuitive GUI**: The program should feature an intuitive GUI where functionality is easily accessible.
- **Class Selection**: The client should be able to select the appropriate classroom when using features like group creation.
- **Notes Section**: The client should have a dedicated area to write and store notes.
- **Class Import**: The client should be able to import class lists via a text file containing student names.
- **Ease of Use**: The program must enhance classroom efficiency without adding complexity.
